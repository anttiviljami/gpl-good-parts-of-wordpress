# GPL: The Good Parts of WordPress

## WordPress is GPL

- WordPress is GPL, but what does that mean?
- It means it's open source!
- The source is open, that means anyone can read the code. Let's take a look...
- In fact, it says right here in the Source Code: "WordPress is GPL"

## What else does GPL say?

- GPL is an Open Source software license.
- But it's long, and it's just a bunch of legalese most people don't understand.
- So what does the GPL actually say?

## The 4 Freedoms

- Let's ask RMS
- 0.-3.
- Ok cool, why should I care?

## Your WordPress code is GPL too

- The GPL License states that any program that uses parts of another GPL
  Licensed program, is also licensed under the GPL and must contain the GPL
  license.
- That is, if you distribute your code for other people to use.
- That means all WordPress plugins and themes; doesn't matter if they're paid
  or free, are Open Source.

- That's a good thing!

- Some people don't think so. (Ballmer quote)

## Open Source is Awesome

### You own it

You don't need anyone's permissions or pay a license to use or further develop
the software.

This is especially important for companies and organisations, who need the
freedom to keep the playground fair for developers, and not get stuck with just
one vendor who can set any price they like for their services, since they're
the only one with the expertise or legal rights to modify the program.

This is called **Vendor lock-in**, and in most cases causes significant issues
for the licensee with the vendor setting extremely high prices.

### Quality

Big companies around the world are depending on WordPress. Thanks to GPL, they
share their improvements, making WordPress better and more secure for everyone.

If and when security flaws are reported, the source maintainers work to include
a fix in the source code, so the next time you update, you're safe from the
risk.

Many times, someone will develop a new feature for WordPress, like a plugin
that gets adopted to the WordPress core in a feature update.

Examples (https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/):

- Emojis
- Rest API
- Customizer

### Extendability

You can study the source code for free and create plugins and themes to make
WordPress do amazing things.

You can even make money by selling your themes and plugins, or give premium
support to people who use your plugin.

Yes, GPL still allows you to sell your code. Lots of companies do it!

## GPL Does Not...

### Mean Software is Free of Charge
